# Grok3API: Client for Working with Grok 🤖



**Grok3API** is a powerful and convenient unofficial client for interacting with Grok models (including Grok3), allowing you to send requests, receive text responses, and, most notably, **generated images** — all with automatic cookie management! 🎨✨ The project is designed with a focus on ease of use and automation, so you can concentrate on creativity rather than technical details.

---

## 🌟 Features

- 🚀 **Automatic cookie retrieval** via browser with bypassing Cloudflare — no manual setup required!
- 🖼️ **Convenient retrieval of generated images** with the `save_to` method, enabling you to save them with a single click.
- 🔄 **Automatic cookie updates** for errors like "Too Many Requests" or "Unauthorized".
- 🔧 **Flexible request configuration**: model selection, image generation management, attachment addition, and more.
- 📦 **Attachment support**: send files and images along with your requests.
- 🛠️ **Error handling**: the client resolves cookie issues and retries requests if something goes wrong.
- 🤖 **[Telegram bot example](tests/SimpleTgBot/SimpleTgBot.py) (`grok3api` + `aiogram`)**, with the ability to create text replies and images.

## 📦 Installation

To start using Grok3API, install the necessary dependencies. It’s simple:

```bash
pip install grok3api
```

> ⚠️ **Important**: Ensure you have **Google Chrome** installed, as `undetected_chromedriver` works specifically with it.

After installing, you’re ready to begin! 🎉

## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start

Here’s a complete example of how to send a request and save a generated image:

```python
from grok3api.client import GrokClient


def main():
    # Create a client (cookies will be automatically retrieved if not present)
    client = GrokClient()

    # Create a request
    message = "Create an image of a ship"

    # Send the request
    result = client.send_message(message)
    print("Grok's response:", result.modelResponse.message)

    # Save the first image if available
    if result.modelResponse.generatedImages:
        result.modelResponse.generatedImages[0].save_to("ship.jpg")
        print("Image saved as ship.jpg! 🚀")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This code:
1. Creates a client (cookies are fetched automatically if absent).
2. Sends a request to generate an image.
3. Saves the result to the file `ship.jpg`.

**📌 What will we see?**  
Grok will generate an image of a **ship**, for example, something like this:  

<img src="assets/ship.jpg" alt="Example spaceship" width="500">

> 💡 **Tip**: You don’t need to manually obtain cookies — the client handles it for you!

## 🔧 Request Parameters

The `ChatCompletion.create` method accepts numerous parameters to customize your request. Here’s an example with settings:

```python
from grok3api.client import GrokClient


def main():
    # Create a client
    client = GrokClient()

    # Send a request with settings
    result = client.send_message(
        message="Draw a cat",
        modelName="grok-3",  # Default is grok-3
        imageGenerationCount=2,  # I want 2 cat images!
    )
    print(f"Grok3's response: {result.modelResponse.message}")

    # Save all images
    for i, img in enumerate(result.modelResponse.generatedImages):
        img.save_to(f"cat_{i}.jpg")
        print(f"Saved: cat_{i}.jpg 🐾")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## 🖼️ Convenient Image Handling

One of the standout features of GrokClient is its **super-convenient handling of generated images**. Here’s a complete example:

```python
from grok3api.client import GrokClient


def main():
    # Create a client
    client = GrokClient()

    # Send a request
    result = client.send_message("Draw a sunset over the sea")

    # Save all images
    for i, image in enumerate(result.modelResponse.generatedImages):
        image.save_to(f"sunset_{i}.jpg")
        print(f"Saved: sunset_{i}.jpg 🌅")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

> 🌟 **Cool Fact**: This works with automatically retrieved cookies! You don’t need to worry about access — the client sets everything up for you.

---

## 🔄 Automatic Cookie Retrieval

If cookies are missing or outdated, GrokClient automatically:
1. Uses a Chrome browser (ensure it’s installed).
2. Visits `https://grok.com/`.
3. Bypasses Cloudflare protection.
4. Will continue to work.

You don’t need to do anything manually — just run the code, and it will work!

---

## 💾 Saving Cookies

After retrieval, cookies are saved to the `cookies.txt` file.

On subsequent runs, the client will automatically use them unless you provide your own.

---

## 📋 Response Processing

The `create` method returns a `GrokResponse` object. Here’s an example of working with it:

```python
from grok3api.client import GrokClient


def main():
    # Create a client
    client = GrokClient()

    # Send a request
    result = client.send_message("Describe and draw a forest")

    # Process the response
    print(f"Text: {result.modelResponse.message}")
    if result.modelResponse.generatedImages:
        result.modelResponse.generatedImages[0].save_to("forest.jpg")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

**Fields of the `GrokResponse` object:**
- **`modelResponse`**: The main model response.
  - `message` (str): The text response.
  - `generatedImages` (List[GeneratedImage]): List of images.
- **`isThinking`**: Whether the model was thinking (bool).
- **`isSoftStop`**: Soft stop (bool).
- **`responseId`**: Response ID (str).
- **`newTitle`**: New chat title, if available (Optional[str]).

---

## 🚨 Error Handling

GrokClient is equipped to handle issues:
- **HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)**: Automatically updates cookies and retries the request.
- **Missing cookies**: Retrieves them via the browser.
- **Other errors**: Logged for debugging.
